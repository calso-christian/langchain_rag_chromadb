# 🔍 LangChain RAG with ChromaDB

This repository implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** using **LangChain** and **ChromaDB**, allowing efficient and scalable retrieval of relevant documents to enhance LLM responses.

## 🚀 Features  
- **ChromaDB as a vector store** for fast and efficient retrieval  
- **LangChain integration** for building retrieval workflows  
- **Support for multiple embeddings** (e.g., OpenAI, Sentence-Transformers)  
- **Query augmentation** using context from retrieved documents
